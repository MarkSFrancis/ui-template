# UI Template

This is an extremely barebones HTML, JS and CSS project, with bootstrap and http-server (via npm), meant for throwing together UI prototypes in CSS/ HTML/ JS.

The template HTML file sets up the minimal for HTML 5 (viewport scaling, language, IE compatibility, etc.). It also comes with Bootstrap (with jQuery and Popper), and a default empty CSS and JS file.

The template package.json includes a script that starts up http-server, disabling browser cache. The .vscode config starts up Google Chrome on the relevant port, at `./index.html`
