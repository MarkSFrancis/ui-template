# UI Template

This is an extremely barebones HTML, JS and SCSS project, with bootstrap and webpack (via npm), meant for throwing together UI prototypes in CSS/ HTML/ JS.

The template HTML file sets up the minimal for HTML 5 (viewport scaling, language, etc.). It also comes with Bootstrap (with jQuery and Popper), and a default empty SCSS and JS file.

The template package.json includes a script that starts up webpack, with hot-reloading. The .vscode config starts up Google Chrome on the relevant port
